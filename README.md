# ophelia-ci-deployment

This repo shows examples of deployment of the ophelia-ci project. The current project contains k8s and charm deployments.

This repo consists in a way of encapsulating all deployment logic of the [ophelia-ci](https://www.github.com/EdmilsonRodrigues/ophelia-ci) project. This way the deployment logic does not mix with the project logic.
